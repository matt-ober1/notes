**What is a Loader?**

- A loader is a type of malware or a component of an exploit kit that is responsible for loading additional malicious code or payloads onto a compromised system.
- Its primary function is to act as a bridge between the initial exploit and the final payload, facilitating the delivery and execution of the malicious code.
- Loaders are often used to evade detection by security software and to make it more difficult for researchers to analyze the malicious code.

**Key Characteristics of a Loader:**

- Typically small in size and lightweight, making it easy to transmit and execute.
- Designed to be stealthy and evade detection by security software.
- May use various techniques to obfuscate its code and behavior.
- Often communicates with a command and control (C2) server to receive instructions and updates.
- Can load a variety of payloads, including ransomware, Trojans, and other types of malware.

**Types of Loaders:**

- **Stager loaders**: Load a small piece of code that downloads and executes the final payload.
- **Reflective loaders**: Load the payload into memory without writing it to disk.
- **Injectors**: Load the payload into the memory space of a legitimate process.
- **Bootloaders**: Load the payload during the system boot process.

**Loader Techniques:**

- Code obfuscation and anti-debugging techniques to evade detection.
- Use of legitimate system functions and APIs to blend in with normal system activity.
- Encryption and compression to conceal the payload.
- Use of alternative data streams and hidden files to store the payload.

**Detection and Mitigation:**

- Network traffic monitoring and analysis to detect suspicious communication with C2 servers.
- System monitoring and logging to detect unusual system activity.
- Implementation of security software and intrusion detection systems to detect and block loader activity.
- Regular system updates and patching to prevent exploitation of vulnerabilities.

**Initial Access and Delivery:**

- **Social engineering**: Trick users into executing malicious files or visiting malicious websites.
- **Exploit kits**: Exploit vulnerabilities in web browsers or plugins to deliver malware.
- **Phishing**: Send deceptive emails with malicious attachments or links.
- **Drive-by downloads**: Compromise legitimate websites to deliver malware silently.

**Evasion Techniques:**

- **Anti-VM/anti-sandboxing**: Detect and evade analysis in virtual machines or sandbox environments.
    - Check for virtualization or sandbox-specific indicators.
    - Limit or delay malicious activity until certain conditions are met.
- **Anti-emulation**: Detect and evade analysis by behavior-based or emulation-based security solutions.
    - Use environment-specific checks to identify emulators or sandboxes.
    - Implement anti-VM and anti-sandboxing techniques.
- **Code obfuscation**: Make the malicious code difficult to analyze by using techniques such as:
    - Packing: Compress or encrypt the code.
    - Polymorphism: Change the code's appearance while maintaining its functionality.
    - Metamorphism: Modify the code's structure and functionality.
- **Anti-debugging**: Prevent or hinder analysis by using techniques such as:
    - Checking for debuggers or disassemblers.
    - Using anti-debugging APIs or tricks.
    - Implementing dead code or red herrings.
- **Time delays and sleeps**: Delay the execution of malicious activity to evade real-time monitoring.
- **Environment-specific checks**: Check for specific system or user indicators to tailor the attack or evade detection.
- **Legitimate process injection**: Inject malicious code into legitimate processes to blend in with normal system activity.
- **Hidden files and alternative data streams**: Store malicious files in hidden locations or use alternative data streams to evade detection.
- **Fileless malware**: Exploit legitimate system tools or scripts to execute malicious code without writing files to disk.
- **Living off the land (LoL)**: Use legitimate system tools and utilities to perform malicious activities, making it harder to detect.
- **User account control (UAC) bypass**: Bypass UAC prompts to gain elevated privileges without user interaction.
- **Persistence**: Maintain a presence on the system by creating registry keys, scheduled tasks, or other persistent mechanisms.


**Entropy and AV Evasion:**

- Entropy is a measure of randomness or disorder of a system.
- Malware often contains highly randomized, encrypted, and/or encoded code to evade detection.
- Anti-virus products use entropy analysis to identify potentially malicious files and payloads.

**Importance of Entropy in Obfuscation:**

- Sophisticated AV/EDRs can detect obfuscated code with high entropy.
- Breaking signatures is easy, but ignoring entropy can lead to detection.

**Entropy Principle:**

- Higher entropy indicates higher likelihood of obfuscation or encryption.
- Higher entropy increases the probability of a file/payload being malicious.

**Measuring Entropy:**

- Claude E. Shannon introduced a formula to measure entropy in a set of data (1948 paper: A Mathematical Theory of Communication).
- This formula can be used to calculate the entropy of a dataset.

**EDR Evasion Techniques:**

- **EDR bypass**: Identify and bypass EDR-specific checks or APIs to evade detection.
- **EDR fingerprinting**: Identify EDR solutions by checking for specific indicators or behaviors.
- **EDR anti-evasion**: Implement countermeasures to detect and block EDR evasion techniques.
- **EDR evasion through legitimate tools**: Use legitimate tools or scripts to mimic normal system activity and evade EDR detection.

**Countermeasures:**

- Keep systems and software up-to-date with the latest patches and security updates.
- Implement a multi-layered security approach, combining various security solutions and techniques.
- Use behavior-based and machine learning-based detection methods to identify and block evasive malware.
- Monitor network traffic for suspicious communication or activity.
- Regularly review and analyze system logs and events for signs of compromise.
- Educate users on how to recognize and avoid social engineering attacks.
- Implement application whitelisting and other restrictive security measures to limit the impact of successful attacks.
