## Network Devices

### Routers
- Direct traffic between different networks.
- Features: DHCP, NAT, firewall.

### Switches
- Connect devices within the same network.
- Types: Managed (configurable), Unmanaged (plug-and-play).

### Access Points
- Provide wireless connectivity.
- Can be standalone or part of a router.

### Modems
- Connect to ISPs, convert analog signals to digital.
- Types: DSL, Cable, Fiber.

## IP Addressing

### IPv4
- 32-bit address, e.g., 192.168.1.1.
- Classes: A (1.0.0.0 to 126.0.0.0), B (128.0.0.0 to 191.255.0.0), C (192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.0).

### IPv6
- 128-bit address, e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334.
- Designed to replace IPv4, offers a larger address space.

### DHCP
- Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol.
- Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on a network.

### DNS
- Domain Name System.
- Translates domain names to IP addresses.

## Wireless Standards

### 802.11a
- Frequency: 5 GHz.
- Speed: Up to 54 Mbps.

### 802.11b
- Frequency: 2.4 GHz.
- Speed: Up to 11 Mbps.

### 802.11g
- Frequency: 2.4 GHz.
- Speed: Up to 54 Mbps.

### 802.11n
- Frequency: 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz.
- Speed: Up to 600 Mbps.

### 802.11ac
- Frequency: 5 GHz.
- Speed: Up to 1.3 Gbps.

### 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6)
- Frequency: 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz.
- Speed: Up to 10 Gbps.

## Protocols

### TCP/IP
- Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol.
- Ensures reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data.

### UDP
- User Datagram Protocol.
- Faster, connectionless, but less reliable than TCP.

### HTTP/S
- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (Secure).
- Used for web traffic, HTTPS adds encryption.

### FTP
- File Transfer Protocol.
- Used for transferring files, FTP over SSL (FTPS) adds security.

### SMB
- Server Message Block.
- Used for sharing files, printers, and serial ports.

### CIFS
- Common Internet File System.
- A form of SMB, used for file sharing in Windows.

## Network Topologies

### Star
- All devices connected to a central hub.
- Advantages: Easy to add devices, isolation of devices.
- Disadvantages: Hub failure affects entire network.

### Mesh
- Devices interconnected, provides redundancy.
- Advantages: High availability, fault tolerance.
- Disadvantages: Complex setup, expensive.

### Bus
- All devices connected to a single cable.
- Advantages: Simple, inexpensive.
- Disadvantages: Cable failure affects entire network, limited scalability.

### Ring
- Devices connected in a circular fashion.
- Advantages: Easy to install, predictable performance.
- Disadvantages: Failure of a single device can affect the network, difficult troubleshooting.

## Network Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **No Connectivity**: Check cables, network devices, and configurations.
- **Slow Performance**: Check for network congestion, hardware issues, or malware.
- **Intermittent Connectivity**: Check for interference, faulty cables, or overheating devices.

### Tools
- **Multimeter**: Measure electrical properties.
- **POST Card**: Diagnose motherboard issues.
- **Loopback Plugs**: Test network ports.
- **WiFi Analyzer**: Check wireless signal strength and interference.

### Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Identify the Problem**: Gather information, duplicate the issue.
2. **Establish a Theory of Probable Cause**: Check for common issues.
3. **Test the Theory**: Implement a plan to test your theory.
4. **Establish a Plan of Action**: Create a step-by-step plan to resolve the issue.
5. **Verify Full System Functionality**: Ensure the problem is resolved and no new issues are introduced.
6. **Document Findings, Actions, and Outcomes**: Keep records for future reference.
