- Mitigate Risk 
- Compliance 
- Business Continuity
- Legal Regulation


## Asset Security
- Secure Digital and Physical Assets in a Safe Manner
- Storage, Maintenance, Retention, and Destruction of Data


## Security Architecture and Engineering
- Optimize Data Security Through Tools, Procedures, and Methods


## Communication and Network Security
- managing and securing physical and wireless comms

## Identity and Access Management (IAM)
    
- Focuses on access and authorization to secure data.
- Ensures user access is limited to what employees need.
- Reduces overall risk to systems and data.
- Components of IAM:
- Identification: User verifies identity (username, access card, biometric data).
        - **Authentication:** Verification process (password, PIN).
        - **Authorization:** Determines level of access based on role.
        - **Accountability:** Monitors and records user actions.
## Security Assessment and Testing
    
- Conducts security control testing, collects and analyzes data, and conducts security audits.
- Identifies new ways to mitigate threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.
- Evaluates if current controls meet organizational goals.
- Uses evaluations and reports to improve or implement new controls (e.g., multi-factor authentication).
## Security Operations
    
- Focuses on conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures.
- Investigations start after identifying a security incident.
- Urgency is required to minimize risks during an active attack.
- Collects digital and physical evidence for forensic investigation post-incident.
- Forensic investigation helps identify breach details and areas for improvement.

## Software Development Security
    
- Uses secure coding practices in the software development lifecycle.
- Ensures security is integrated into each phase of the lifecycle:
	 **Design Phase:** Secure design review.
    **Development and Testing Phases:** Secure code reviews.
    **Deployment and Implementation Phases:** Penetration testing.
    **Keeps software secure, protects sensitive data, and mitigates risk.**
