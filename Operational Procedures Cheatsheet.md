## Safety and Environmental Procedures

### Electrical Safety
- **Use Proper Cables**: Ensure cables are rated for the electrical load.
- **Avoid Overloading Circuits**: Do not exceed the circuit's capacity.
- **Unplug Equipment**: Disconnect equipment during maintenance or when not in use.
- **Use Grounding**: Ensure proper grounding to prevent electrical shocks.
- **Inspect Equipment**: Regularly check cables and plugs for damage.

### Fire Safety
- **Fire Extinguishers**: Use appropriate types (e.g., CO2, ABC) for different fires.
- **Smoke Detectors**: Install and maintain smoke detectors in all areas.
- **Emergency Exits**: Clearly mark and keep pathways to emergency exits unobstructed.
- **Fire Drills**: Conduct regular fire drills to ensure everyone knows emergency procedures.

### Ergonomics
- **Workstation Setup**: Ensure monitors are at eye level and chairs provide proper support.
- **Regular Breaks**: Encourage breaks to reduce strain and avoid repetitive stress injuries.
- **Proper Posture**: Maintain correct posture while working to avoid back and neck strain.

### Handling Hazardous Materials
- **MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheets)**: Review for information on handling and disposal.
- **Proper Storage**: Store hazardous materials in designated, secure locations.
- **Protective Equipment**: Use gloves, masks, and other protective gear as required.

## Procedures and Best Practices

### Documentation
- **Change Management**: Document changes to systems and configurations.
- **Incident Reports**: Record details of any incidents and responses.
- **Backup Procedures**: Document backup schedules and procedures.

### Backup and Recovery
- **Regular Backups**: Schedule and perform regular backups of critical data.
- **Backup Types**:
  - **Full Backup**: Complete backup of all data.
  - **Incremental Backup**: Backs up only the data changed since the last backup.
  - **Differential Backup**: Backs up data changed since the last full backup.
- **Testing**: Regularly test backup and recovery procedures to ensure data can be restored.

### Change Management
- **Request and Approval**: Changes should be requested and approved before implementation.
- **Implementation**: Follow a structured process to apply changes.
- **Review and Documentation**: Document changes and review their impact.

### Incident Response
- **Identification**: Recognize and classify the incident.
- **Containment**: Isolate the issue to prevent further damage.
- **Eradication**: Remove the cause of the incident.
- **Recovery**: Restore systems and services to normal operation.
- **Post-Incident Review**: Analyze and document the incident and response for future improvement.

## Disaster Recovery

### Planning
- **Disaster Recovery Plan**: Create a comprehensive plan for recovery from various disaster scenarios.
- **Business Impact Analysis (BIA)**: Identify critical business functions and the impact of disruptions.
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: Define the maximum acceptable downtime for critical functions.
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: Define the maximum acceptable data loss.

### Testing
- **Regular Drills**: Conduct regular drills to ensure readiness and ide
