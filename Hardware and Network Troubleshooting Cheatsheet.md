## Hardware Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Power Issues
- **Symptom**: No power, system doesnâ€™t turn on.
- **Solution**:
  - Check power cable and outlet.
  - Verify power supply unit (PSU) functionality.
  - Ensure power button connections to the motherboard are secure.

#### Overheating
- **Symptom**: System shuts down unexpectedly, high CPU/GPU temperatures.
- **Solution**:
  - Clean dust from fans and heatsinks.
  - Ensure proper airflow inside the case.
  - Reapply thermal paste on CPU.

#### POST (Power-On Self-Test) Errors
- **Symptom**: Beep codes, error messages during startup.
- **Solution**:
  - Refer to motherboard manual for beep code meanings.
  - Check and reseat RAM and expansion cards.
  - Verify all connections and components are properly seated.

#### Display Issues
- **Symptom**: No display, artifacts, screen flickering.
- **Solution**:
  - Check monitor connections and power.
  - Test with a different monitor or cable.
  - Reseat or replace the graphics card.

### Diagnostic Tools
- **Multimeter**: Measure electrical properties.
- **POST Card**: Diagnose motherboard issues.
- **Loopback Plugs**: Test network ports.
- **Power Supply Tester**: Check PSU functionality.

## Network Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Connectivity Issues
- **Symptom**: No network connection.
- **Solution**:
  - Check physical connections (Ethernet cables, Wi-Fi signal).
  - Verify network adapter status in Device Manager.
  - Restart router and modem.
  - Use `ipconfig` (Windows) or `ifconfig` (Linux/Mac) to check IP configuration.

#### Slow Network Performance
- **Symptom**: Slow internet or network speeds.
- **Solution**:
  - Check for network congestion or bandwidth-heavy applications.
  - Update network drivers.
  - Use Quality of Service (QoS) settings on the router.
  - Test with a different device to isolate the issue.

#### Intermittent Connectivity
- **Symptom**: Connection drops intermittently.
- **Solution**:
  - Check for interference (e.g., other wireless devices).
  - Ensure firmware is up to date on networking devices.
  - Replace faulty cables or hardware.
  - Move closer to the Wi-Fi router or access point.

### Diagnostic Tools
- **Ping**: Test connectivity to a network host.
  - `ping 8.8.8.8` (Google DNS) to check internet connectivity.
- **Traceroute**: Trace the path packets take to a destination.
  - `tracert` (Windows) or `traceroute` (Linux/Mac).
- **nslookup**: Query DNS servers to obtain domain name or IP address mapping.
- **ipconfig/ifconfig**: Display and configure network interface parameters.
- **Wireshark**: Analyze network traffic and troubleshoot issues.

### Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Identify the Problem**: Gather information, duplicate the issue.
2. **Establish a Theory of Probable Cause**: Check common issues.
3. **Test the Theory**: Implement a plan to test your theory.
4. **Establish a Plan of Action**: Create a step-by-step plan to resolve the issue.
5. **Implement the Solution**: Apply the fix, monitor results.
6. **Verify Full System Functionality**: Ensure the problem is resolved and no new issues are introduced.
7. **Document Findings, Actions, and Outcomes**: Keep records for future reference.

## Hardware-Specific Troubleshooting

### Storage Devices
- **Symptom**: Disk read/write errors, slow performance.
- **Solution**:
  - Check cables and connections.
  - Use disk management tools (e.g., CHKDSK on Windows) to scan and fix errors.
  - Replace faulty drive if necessary.

### RAM Issues
- **Symptom**: System crashes, memory errors.
- **Solution**:
  - Reseat RAM modules.
  - Test with known good RAM.
  - Use memory diagnostic tools (e.g., Windows Memory Diagnostic).

### Peripheral Devices
- **Symptom**: Device not recognized, malfunctioning.
- **Solution**:
  - Check device connections and power.
  - Update or reinstall drivers.
  - Test with a different device or port.

## Network-Specific Troubleshooting

### Wired Connections
- **Symptom**: No connection or limited connectivity.
- **Solution**:
  - Check Ethernet cables and switch/router ports.
  - Verify network configuration (IP address, subnet mask, gateway).
  - Test with a different device or port.

### Wireless Connections
- **Symptom**: Weak signal, intermittent connection.
- **Solution**:
  - Check for interference (other wireless networks, devices).
  - Update router firmware.
  - Change Wi-Fi channel or frequency band.
  - Use a Wi-Fi extender or move closer to the access point.

### Network Services
- **Symptom**: Unable to access specific services (e.g., DNS, DHCP).
- **Solution**:
  - Verify service status on server/device.
  - Check firewall and security settings.
  - Restart affected services or devices.
