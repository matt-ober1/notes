## Motherboards

### Form Factors
- **ATX**: Standard size, common in desktops. Dimensions: 305mm x 244mm.
- **Micro-ATX**: Smaller than ATX, fewer expansion slots. Dimensions: 244mm x 244mm.
- **Mini-ITX**: Smallest, often used in compact and HTPC builds. Dimensions: 170mm x 170mm.

### Chipsets
- Determine CPU compatibility, number of USB ports, SATA connections.
- Examples: Intel Z490, AMD B450.

### Components
- **CPU Socket**: Type (LGA, PGA), compatibility with specific CPUs.
  - **Intel**: LGA 1151, LGA 1200.
  - **AMD**: AM4, TR4 (Threadripper).
- **RAM Slots**: Number of slots, supported RAM type (DDR3, DDR4, DDR5).
- **Expansion Slots**: PCIe slots for GPUs, NICs, sound cards.
- **Power Connectors**: 
  - 24-pin ATX main power.
  - 4/8-pin CPU power.

## CPUs

### Socket Types
- **Intel**: LGA 1151, LGA 1200.
- **AMD**: AM4, TR4 (Threadripper).

### Cooling
- **Heat Sinks**: Passive cooling, relies on airflow.
- **Liquid Cooling**: More efficient, involves radiator and pump.

## RAM

### Types
- **DDR3**: Older standard, slower speeds.
- **DDR4**: Current standard, higher speeds, lower power consumption.
- **DDR5**: Latest standard, higher speeds, better efficiency.

### Form Factors
- **DIMM**: Desktop RAM, typically 240-pin for DDR4.
- **SO-DIMM**: Laptop RAM, typically 204-pin for DDR4.

### Installation Tips
- Ensure correct orientation, use paired slots for dual-channel mode.

## Storage Devices

### HDD
- **Spinning Disks**: Measured in RPM (e.g., 7200 RPM).
- **Advantages**: Cheaper, higher storage capacity.

### SSD
- **Flash Memory**: Faster than HDDs.
- **Interfaces**: SATA (up to 6Gbps), NVMe (up to 32Gbps).

### M.2
- **Compact SSDs**: NVMe offers higher speeds.
- **Dimensions**: 22mm x 80mm (standard size).

### RAID Configurations
- **RAID 0**: Striping, no redundancy, increased speed.
- **RAID 1**: Mirroring, redundancy, no speed increase.
- **RAID 5**: Striping with parity, redundancy, good balance.
- **RAID 10**: Combination of RAID 1 and 0, best performance and redundancy.

## Power Supplies

### Wattage
- Ensure enough power for all components.
- Example: 500W for mid-range systems, 750W+ for high-end builds.

### Connectors
- **24-pin ATX Main Power**: Standard connector.
- **4/8-pin CPU Power**: Provides power to the CPU.

### Efficiency Ratings
- **80 PLUS**: Certification standard.
  - **80 PLUS Bronze**: 82% efficiency at 20% and 100% loads.
  - **80 PLUS Silver**: 85% efficiency at 20% and 100% loads.
  - **80 PLUS Gold**: 87% efficiency at 20% and 100% loads.
  - **80 PLUS Platinum**: 90% efficiency at 20% and 100% loads.
  - **80 PLUS Titanium**: 94% efficiency at 20% and 100% loads.
