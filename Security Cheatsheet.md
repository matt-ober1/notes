## Threats, Attacks, and Vulnerabilities

### Types of Malware
- **Virus**: Attaches to legitimate files/programs and spreads when executed.
- **Worm**: Self-replicates and spreads across networks without user intervention.
- **Trojan Horse**: Disguised as legitimate software but performs malicious actions.
- **Spyware**: Collects user information without consent.
- **Adware**: Displays unwanted ads and may collect data.
- **Ransomware**: Encrypts files and demands ransom for decryption.
- **Rootkit**: Hides presence and activities of other malicious software.
- **Keylogger**: Records keystrokes to steal information.

### Social Engineering
- **Phishing**: Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information via email.
- **Spear Phishing**: Targeted phishing attack on specific individuals.
- **Vishing**: Voice phishing using phone calls.
- **Smishing**: SMS phishing using text messages.
- **Impersonation**: Pretending to be someone else to gain unauthorized access.
- **Shoulder Surfing**: Observing someone's screen or keyboard to gain information.
- **Tailgating**: Following an authorized person into a restricted area without proper authentication.

### Physical Security
- **Lock and Key**: Physical locks to secure equipment and facilities.
- **Badge System**: Identification badges for access control.
- **Biometrics**: Fingerprint, facial recognition, or iris scanning for authentication.
- **Mantraps**: Two-door entry systems to prevent unauthorized access.

## Security Policies and Practices

### User Education and Awareness
- **Training Programs**: Educate users on security best practices and threats.
- **Phishing Simulations**: Test and improve user response to phishing attempts.
- **Regular Updates**: Keep users informed about new threats and policies.

### Password Policies
- **Complexity Requirements**: Enforce use of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
- **Expiration**: Require regular password changes.
- **Account Lockout**: Temporarily disable account after multiple failed login attempts.

### Data Protection
- **Encryption**: Protect data in transit and at rest using encryption.
  - **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**: Commonly used for data encryption.
  - **TLS (Transport Layer Security)**: Encrypts data in transit over networks.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Regularly back up data and test recovery procedures.

### Access Control
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant users only the access necessary to perform their job functions.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Assign permissions based on user roles.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Use multiple methods to verify identity.

## Network Security

### Firewalls
- **Network-Based**: Protects entire networks, installed on network devices.
- **Host-Based**: Protects individual devices, installed on endpoints.
- **Stateful Inspection**: Tracks the state of active connections and makes decisions based on the state and context of traffic.

### Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)
- **IDS (Intrusion Detection System)**: Monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and alerts administrators.
- **IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)**: Monitors network traffic and takes action to block suspicious activity.

### VPN (Virtual Private Network)
- **Site-to-Site VPN**: Connects entire networks to each other.
- **Remote Access VPN**: Allows individual users to connect to a network securely from remote locations.
- **Protocols**: 
  - **IPsec (Internet Protocol Security)**: Provides secure communication over IP networks.
  - **SSL/TLS VPN**: Uses SSL/TLS protocols for secure communication.

## Wireless Security

### Encryption Standards
- **WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)**: Outdated and insecure, should not be used.
- **WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access)**: Improved security over WEP, but still vulnerable.
- **WPA2**: Strong encryption using AES, recommended for secure networks.
- **WPA3**: Latest standard with improved security features.

### Security Practices
- **SSID Hiding**: Do not broadcast the network name (SSID).
- **MAC Filtering**: Allow only specific MAC addresses to connect.
- **Strong Passwords**: Use complex passwords for Wi-Fi access.
- **Guest Networks**: Provide separate network access for guests.

## Device Security

### Mobile Device Management (MDM)
- **Remote Wipe**: Erase data on lost or stolen devices.
- **Encryption**: Ensure device storage is encrypted.
- **App Management**: Control and restrict the installation of apps.
- **Geofencing**: Restrict device functionality based on location.

### Endpoint Protection
- **Antivirus/Antimalware**: Detect and remove malicious software.
- **Host-Based Firewall**: Protect individual devices from network threats.
- **Patch Management**: Regularly update software to fix vulnerabilities.
- **Device Hardening**: Disable unnecessary services and features to reduce attack surface.

## Incident Response

### Steps
1. **Preparation**: Establish and train incident response team, create incident response plan.
2. **Identification**: Detect and identify the incident, gather evidence.
3. **Containment**: Limit the impact and prevent further damage.
4. **Eradication**: Remove the cause of the incident.
5. **Recovery**: Restore systems to normal operation.
6. **Lessons Learned**: Analyze the incident and improve response strategies.

### Documentation
- **Incident Report**: Document the details of the incident, actions taken, and lessons learned.
- **Chain of Custody**: Maintain detailed records of evidence handling.

## Security Controls

### Administrative Controls
- **Policies and Procedures**: Guidelines for behavior and actions.
- **Risk Assessments**: Identify and evaluate risks.
- **Awareness Training**: Educate users about security risks and practices.

### Technical Controls
- **Access Controls**: Manage user permissions and authentication.
- **Encryption**: Protect data confidentiality and integrity.
- **Firewalls**: Monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic.

### Physical Controls
- **Locks**: Secure physical access to equipment and facilities.
- **Surveillance**: Monitor areas with cameras.
- **Security Guards**: Human presence to deter and respond to threats.
